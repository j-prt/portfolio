          <Paragraph>
            I like the idea of blogging, but I haven&apos;t decided on a structure or a framework. I
            have a loose set of goals, but no project requirements. Mainly, I wanted to practise
            designing pages and layouts â€” that&apos;s what got me this far. I expect most posts will
            be fairly short impressions on media or reflections on something I learned recently.
